Usage: decompose_samples.py

Use this script to normalize Roman map keys to use combining characters
(decomposed glyphs) vs. pre-composed glyphs.

The script will create a new CSV file named according to the source.
E.g. `myscript.csv` â†’ `myscript_norm.csv`.

NOTE: the script does not parse the CSV, it scans it as a plain text file. It
is unlikely but possible that some normalization may lead to an invalid CSV.
