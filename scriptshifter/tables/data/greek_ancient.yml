      "The document notes: \"The h is supplied as appropriate when the rough
        breathing does not appear in the Greek text (for example, when the text
        is in all capitals, or, in Modern Greek, when the text is in monotonic
        orthography).\" This is not implemented as it would assume that a
        specific word be known to have a rough breathing."
