    # Incorrectly entered (but frequently found) Roman numerals.
    # NOTE There is ambiguity about ignoring these
    # words. Note that the single-character Roman
    # numerals are not included on purpose.
    # Ideally the source editors should use the
    # dedicated U+2160÷U+216F (uppercase Roman
    # numerals) and/or U+2170÷U+217F (lower case Roman
    # numerals) ranges to avoid this ambiguity.
